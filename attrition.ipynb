Accuracy is not the best metric to use on this data. Considering the question is predicting whether employees are likely to leave the company which this data doesn't seem to answer the question. This data shows the accuracy of the model, it needs to identify employees who leave and possibly variables for the reason of their departure of the company, this information would be based on company historical employee turnover.\n","\n","2. The activation functions that I chose for the output layers were the sigmoid function and the softmax function. The sigmoid function is better suited to determine if an employee will leave or not. The sigmoid function output values are 0 and 1, which are assigned to yes and no results converted into binary numbers. The softmax decision is better suited to determine a more suitable department for an employee, the result is a probability for the departments.\n","\n","3. A few ways that this model could be improved would be add previous employee data, their reasons for leaving or requesting transfers to another department. Try balancing the data when there is a higher number of employees in certain departments, possibly adding information as to why a department has a higher number employees than another. Possibly do more data splits to give a better understanding of the model's predictions."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"QABSigXQda87"},"source":[]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.18"},"vscode":{"interpreter":{"hash":"31f2aee4e71d21fbe5cf8b01ff0e069b9275f58929596ceb00d14d90e3e16cd6"}}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
